Experiment No. 3
Title:
Conduct a Phishing Attack Simulation using Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) on Kali Linux
Objective:
To understand social engineering techniques by simulating a phishing attack in a controlled
lab environment using the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) in Kali Linux.
Software/Tools Required:
- Kali Linux
- Terminal
- Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) (pre-installed in Kali Linux)
- Test browser/system (victim simulation) in an isolated network environment
Theory:
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing
confidential information (such as usernames, passwords, or financial data) by posing as a
trusted entity, often via fake websites or emails.
Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) is a framework in Kali Linux designed for penetration
testing and simulating social engineering attacks for educational purposes.
Types of Phishing Simulations in SET:
- Website Cloner: Duplicates a real login page to capture credentials.
- Credential Harvester: Captures usernames and passwords entered on a phishing page.
- Email Phishing: Sends a crafted phishing email with malicious links.
Procedure:
1. Update Kali Linux:
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y
2. Launch Social Engineering Toolkit:
sudo setoolkit
Accept the terms.
3. Choose Social-Engineering Attacks:
1) Social-Engineering Attacks
4. Select Website Attack Vectors:
2) Website Attack Vectors

5. Choose Credential Harvester Attack Method:
3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
6. Select Site Cloner:
2) Site Cloner
7. Enter Your IP Address (attacker machine’s IP) for hosting the phishing page.
8. Enter URL to Clone (example: http://example.com)
9. Access from Victim Machine: Open http://&lt;attacker_IP&gt; and enter dummy
credentials.
Outcome:
By the end of this experiment, students will:
- Understand how phishing websites are created and hosted in a lab.
- Learn credential harvesting techniques in a safe environment.
- Recognize indicators of phishing attacks.
Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrated the creation of a phishing page using SET in Kali Linux and
how credentials can be harvested. It reinforced the importance of security awareness, URL
verification, and multi-factor authentication to prevent such attacks.
