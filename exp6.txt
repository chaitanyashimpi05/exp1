Computer systems store user passwords in a special file called the shadow file (/etc/shadow).
To protect users, passwords are not saved in plain text. Instead, they are converted into a scrambled form called a hash using cryptographic hashing algorithms like:

MD5 → $1$

SHA-256 → $5$

SHA-512 → $6$

yescrypt → $y$ (used in newer Linux systems)

Hashing is one-way, meaning the original password cannot be directly recovered.

To check the strength of passwords and to perform security auditing, tools like John the Ripper (JtR) are used.
John the Ripper is an open-source password-cracking tool. It works by:

Reading password hashes from files like /etc/shadow.

Applying different attacks such as:

Dictionary Attack — tries passwords from a wordlist (like rockyou.txt).

Brute Force Attack — tries all possible combinations.

Rule-based Attack — modifies dictionary words (adding numbers, symbols).

Comparing generated hashes to the actual hash in the shadow file.

If the hashes match, the password is “cracked.”

This experiment helps understand:

How Linux stores passwords.

How weak passwords can be cracked easily.

Why strong hashing algorithms and strong passwords are necessary.

Why system administrators must use secure hashing methods and strong password policies to protect user accounts.

📘 CONCLUSION (Simple & Easy Language)

In this practical, we learned how Linux saves password hashes securely in the /etc/shadow file and how these hashes can be analyzed using John the Ripper.
By performing password cracking using a wordlist, we observed that:

Weak or common passwords can be cracked easily.

Strong passwords are difficult or impossible to crack using simple attacks.

Modern hashing methods like yescrypt ($y$) are highly secure and John may not crack them easily.

The experiment shows the importance of choosing long, complex, and unique passwords to protect accounts.

It also highlights why system administrators must implement secure hashing algorithms and enforce strong password policies.

Thus, the practical successfully demonstrated password security concepts, the working of John the Ripper, and the importance of having strong passwords to protect systems.
npm install zxcvbn

step 1: john

step 2: sudo adduser user1
sudo adduser user2

step 3: sudo cp /etc/shadow ~/shadow1
sudo chmod 644 ~/shadow1

step 4: cat shadow1

step 5: sudo john --wordlist=/home/kali/wordlist.txt shadow1
