Experiment No. 2
Title:
Use a Password Strength Tester to Evaluate the Strength of Various Passwords

Objective:
To understand the importance of strong passwords and evaluate different types of passwords
using tools like cracklib-check, pwscore, and zxcvbn on Kali Linux.

Software/Tools Required:
 Kali Linux
 Terminal
 Tools: cracklib-runtime, libpam-pwquality, zxcvbn (Node.js)

Theory:
What is Password Strength?
Password strength is a measure of how resistant a password is to guessing and brute-force
attacks. Strong passwords are:
 At least 12–16 characters long
 Contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
 Avoid common words, names, or predictable patterns
 Not reused from other accounts

Common Password Evaluation Tools in Kali Linux:
Tool/Command Description
cracklib-check Checks passwords against a dictionary and known patterns
pwscore Rates password strength on a scale from 0 to 100
zxcvbn Advanced strength estimator with time-to-crack estimation
john (John the Ripper) Cracking simulator tool, tests password resilience

Installation Commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcrack2 cracklib-runtime libpam-pwquality nodejs npm
npm install -g zxcvbn

Procedure:
1. Using cracklib-check:
echo &quot;Password123&quot; | cracklib-check
Output:
Password123: it is based on a dictionary word

2. Using pwscore:
echo &quot;D3f!AnT#92&quot; | pwscore
Output:
A numeric score out of 100.

3. Using zxcvbn:
zxcvbn &quot;Welcome@2025&quot;
npm install -g zxcvbn
nano testpass.js
paste;
const zxcvbn = require('zxcvbn');
const password = process.argv[2];

if (!password) {
    console.log("Usage: node testpass.js <password>");
    process.exit(1);
}

const result = zxcvbn(password);
console.log(result);

(CTRL + O, ENTER, CTRL + X)

node testpass.js "Welcome@2025"



Output:
Shows password score (0–4), estimated crack time, and feedback.

Sample Passwords and Evaluation:
Password Tool Used Strength Score Comments
123456 cracklib/pwscore Very Weak (5) Common, predictable
password cracklib/zxcvbn Very Weak (0) Dictionary word
Password123 zxcvbn Weak (1) Simple pattern
Pa$$w0rd2025! pwscore Moderate (45) Decent mix, still somewhat predictable
Zx!7@qP#v9D3 zxcvbn Very Strong (4) Long, complex, high entropy
iloveyou cracklib Very Weak Common phrase

Outcome:
By the end of this experiment, students will be able to:

 Identify characteristics of weak vs strong passwords
 Evaluate password strength using multiple tools
 Understand time-to-crack estimates and dictionary-based weakness
 Apply secure password practices in real-world scenarios

Conclusion:
This experiment helped students understand the importance of strong passwords and
demonstrated how different tools can analyze and rate password security, helping in
developing better security hygiene.
