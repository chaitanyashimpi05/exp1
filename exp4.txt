Experiment No. 4
 Title:
Perform a network scanning and vulnerability detection using tools like Nmap

Objective:
To learn how to scan a network using Nmap, identify live hosts, open ports, and detect possible vulnerabilities. This helps us understand the attack surface of a system.

Software/Tools Required:
* Kali Linux
* Terminal
* Nmap

Theory:
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool for scanning networks. It detects active devices, services running on different ports, and possible vulnerabilities. Attackers use it for reconnaissance, while security professionals use it for defense and auditing.


Installation Commands:
Tool: zphisher
1. Open Kali Linux Terminal Emulator
2. Commands:
sudo apt install nmap ? (Install Nmap on Linux)
Enter password and hit enter
3. Once the installation is done, 
4. nmap <IP> ? (Basic scan to find live host and open ports)
5. nmap -sV <IP> ? (Detect services and versions running)

Note: In <IP> paste target IPv4 Address

Outcome:
We performed scanning with Nmap and found open ports and running services on the target system. Using service detection and vulnerability scripts, we identified potential weak points. This gave us practical exposure to reconnaissance and security auditing.
Conclusion:
The experiment shows the importance of Nmap in ethical hacking and cybersecurity. It highlights how attackers gather system details, but also how administrators can use the same tool to strengthen defenses.
